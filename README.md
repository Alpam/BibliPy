# BibliPy

## Presentation

BibliPy is my newest project. With this module I want to implement a data base
manager. As far as I know all librairies or modules use to manage a data base don't
implement the data base themself. They are only used as a link between the code and the
API.
This module will provide the classics requests and all the functions to create and manage
tables. But the real point of this module will laid in the hash tables. By default 
the data base will use some hash tables according to table size. But if needed the hash
tables will be totally customable, as well all principals python types will be usable in
the fields of the tables.
When the table is create, a machine will be callable, it will wait for requests.
